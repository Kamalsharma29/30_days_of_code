# 30_days_of_code🚀

Welcome to my 30 Days of Code repository! In this repository, I will be sharing my daily progress as I work on improving my skills in data structures and algorithms. The goal of this project is to dedicate 30 consecutive days to study and implement various data structures and algorithms, and to document my journey here on GitHub.

[Daily Progress] 📅 Daily solve LeetCode problems in 30 days
#Introduction 📚
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. This project is aimed at helping me build a strong foundation in these topics by dedicating focused time every day for a month.

# Daily progress ✨


You can find my daily progress in the LeetCode directory on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamalsharma29) Each day, I will be adding a new folder with the date as its name, and inside each folder, you will find:

Code implementations
Explanations and comments
Any additional resources or notes
Feel free to explore the daily progress and provide feedback or suggestions.

I will also maintain a list of resources that I find helpful throughout this journey. You can find them in the . If you have any recommendations for resources that might be beneficial for me or others, please feel free to suggest them.

While this repository primarily documents my personal journey, I welcome contributions in the form of suggestions, corrections, or additional resources. If you have any ideas or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for joining me on this 30 Days of Code journey! Let's learn and grow together in the world of data structures and algorithms. 📊👩‍💻
